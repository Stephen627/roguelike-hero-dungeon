# Roguelike Hero Dungeon

## Base Gameplay
- Team of 3 heroes
- Turn based combat
- Setup stage where you can place your heroes on the borad without knowing where the enemy will spawn
- The longer it takes for you to complete a stage the harder the game will become
- Items to boost the stats of the heroes
  - An item will apply to an individual hero not all of them
- Earn a random item at the end of a stage and earn money by defeating enemies
- Shop to spawn at the end of each stage where you can buy items from a selection
- Heroes will have 5 unique moves
  - General split of moves, although some heroes will be different
    - 3 that are focused around damage
    - 1 for movement
    - 1 for utility
  - Maybe include a range of moves that a hero can have and the player can choose between them
- An entity has 2 actions per turn
  - This may change per entity
  - moving is 1 action
  - using an ability can range between 0 and 2 actions
- Implement line sight
  - Bushes, rocks, etc. will break line of sight
  - Ranged attacks will not be able to hit without line of sight
  - Entities will not be allowed to pass through obstacles


## Hero Ideas
- Rogue
- Warrior
- Mage
- Knight
- Necromancer
- Potion Man
  - Focus around poison and other debuffs
- Cleric
- Monk
- Blood magic user (can use health to power up the attacks)
  - Maybe have a melee based one of these too
